### Book Chapters Summary (fom andynghi@gmail.com)
Book summarizer:
1. There is a book with 20 chapters, content in the file `TheArtOfThinkingClearly.txt` here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J5b4HCwGiRSy7Lwi8Nu3jLUWtwFCshSR/view?usp=sharing

2. Requirement: Write a Golang program using OpenAI API to summary content of each chapter and combined them to a file TheArtOfThinkingClearly_Summary.txt, expected content of the file:

```
Summary of Chapter 1:
<summary content>

Summary of Chaper 2:
<summary content>

....
```


Notes:
1. Make the code able to summarize all 20 chapters as fast as possible.
2. Write the code with production quality. Suggestions: have Readme.txt, have an executable script `bin/setup` that is able to install dependencies and/or compile the code and then run your unit test suite. And `bin/summary_book TheArtOfThinkingClearly.txt` should run the program itself.
3. Considering this is a competition contest, please finish your code as fast as possible, there are about 10 people doing this. We will celebrate top guys who finish early with high quality code.
4. If you are new to Golang, the book https://www.gopl.io/ is a great place to start, contact me if you need a copy.
5. I will catch up and maybe pair coding with you if you don't know how to start or are stuck somewhere.
6. You can use this OPENAI_API_KEY: xxxxxx
